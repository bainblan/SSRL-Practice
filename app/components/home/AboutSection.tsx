          The Small Satellite Research Laboratory (SSRL) is developing and launching
          new and innovative technologies into space by utilizing the CubeSat
          platform, a small-scale satellite that is designed for rapid iteration and
          development. The lab is currently driving technological innovation at UGA
          through the building of 2 satellites, funded by the Air Force and NASA.
          The UGA SSRL was founded in 2016, primarily as an avenue for
          undergraduates to design, build, and test space-ready components. Over the
          past three years, the SSRL has steadily increased the reach of its
          research, student involvement, and community enrichment.
